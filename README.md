# LoanDefaultRiceDatathon
## Overview
This project was made for the 2022 [Rice University Datathon](https://datathon.rice.edu), a 24 hour data science challenge in teams of up to 4. With my team, we worked on a dataset of loan defaults and experimented with EDA, creating visuals, predicting loan default, and predicting interest rate.

In this project, we thoroughly worked through the data sceince pipeline, working through the following steps: 
- Cleaning data
- EDA
- Creating visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Modeling
- Model Evalutation

*The skills and models that we used in this project were:*
1. Logistic Regression
2. SMOTE oversampling
3. Linear Regression
4. Random Forrest Regression

I'm very proud of this project and the project we were able to achieve with only 24 hours to work on a complex problem.
